%This script shows simple example of reading in data and plotting a

% Note that data file to be loaded must consist entirely of columns of data
% Edit data to remove headers before loading
% In the example there are 3 columns corresponding to pressure, 
% temperature, and number of soundings respectively. each column has M rows
% A(3,M) is the matrix containing the data
% The data is at altitude interval of 0.5 km starting at z = 0 km

A = load('tropical_temp.dat');  %load the data

%plot temperature versus pressure

subplot(1,2,1)
plot(A(:,2),A(:,1)) %plot 2nd row along x-axis,  first row along y-axis.

%plot temperature versus altitude
%first define an altitude vector with M columns:

s = size(A);  %s is a row vector giving size of A

%note by using the size function the code will work for data files with
%different numbers of points.  
%statement below gives z with same number of rows as A

z = [.5:.5:.5*(s(1))] ; %defines row vector with z values at .5 km interval

plot(A(:,2),z)
